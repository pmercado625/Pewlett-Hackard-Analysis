- According to the analysis that was conducted:

  - The highest amount of retiring employees in a single position is for the Senior Engineer position (25916 positions).
  - The lowest amount of retiring employees in a single position is for the Manager position (2 positions).
  - The total amount of retirement-age employees is 72458.
  - The amount of retiring employees that are available for the mentorship program is 1549.
## Summary
The number of exiting employees is well over 72,000+ people. Out of those people, only 1549 of them can be eligible for mentoring. It is likely that 
all 72,458 of those positions will need to be filled. If there were no more mentors to be added, and assuming every eligible mentor wishes to partake
in the mentorship program, each mentor will mentor ~ 47 new employees each. For the most part, this does not seem too plausible, but that would depend on the 
level of mentorship that is provided. A table that could provide more insight about the silver tsunami would be one of immediate retirement. As employees reach
the age of retirement, it is not for certain that they will retire, as some may still want to work for various reasons. Another possibly helpful table to 
gauge mentorship possibilities, is to have a table that contains the mentorship-eligible people and their corresponding willingness to be mentors to younger
employees.
